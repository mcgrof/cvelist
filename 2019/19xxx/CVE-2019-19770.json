NOTE: Linux kernel developers dispute this issue as not being an issue with debugfs, instead this is an issue with misuse of debugfs within blktrace, a reproducer and fixes are being reviewed, a pointer to the URL and reproducer has been provided on the bugzilla entry filed for the CVE. The severity of the issue is also reduced to only a misuse of blktrace under very specific scenarios:, you must be root to use blktrace, and one must race add/remove of a block device while issuing a BLKTRACESETUP without a BLKTRACETEARDOWN, this can either happen using a hotswappable drive, using virsh and adding/removing a drive, or using the local loopback drive; you then need to use a blktrace inappropriately as root. If this CVE is considered valid then many version of Linux would be affected as the blame is being put on debugfs_remove(), the dispute shows this is not the root case of the crash found. \u201d"
